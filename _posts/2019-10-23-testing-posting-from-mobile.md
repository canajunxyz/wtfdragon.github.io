## Because Blogging On the Go Needs to Be a Thing
There's drawbacks to using technology like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) for blogging; setting up a Wordpress site
is easy enough once hosting has been purchased, or a free account signed up for. And the Wordpress mobile app is decent,
to be sure.

But Wordpress does have its security woes, and the developers do keep changing things...and the not always for the
better (seriously, was it necessary to go to a [Weebly](https://weebly.com)-style posting interface? Plus, it's fun to
try and roll your own solution, which is where technologies like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Of course, to update
a Jeykll-based site on the go isn't as user-friendly, though if one is using [GitHub](https://github.com) to host one's
blog, then an option or two present themselves.

For my part, I'm using [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) to host the files for the GitHub repo that this blog ultimately
resides in; I can then use the Dropbox mobile app to author new posts, which I can then sync to the repo at my leisure.

<b>Update:</b> I had hoped that Dropbox Paper would be useful in this capacity too, but this appears not to be the case.
