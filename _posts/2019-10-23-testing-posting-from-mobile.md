## How to Use This Theme
Just go ahead and read up on [how to install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's not too hard I promise!

Download this repository [here](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively) and save it to any folder you want.

Open a terminal window or a command line and ```cd``` to that location.
